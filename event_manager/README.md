- Well, I forgot to include a README file in this one somehow. This project introduced a lot of ideas and topics and reinforced another bunch of them. I don't feel like the assignment section of this project was terribly difficult, but it was a lot of new information to parse and work through implementing. 
- I feel like the best practice here was to refactor and take out methods from larger codeblocks to make code more readable. I am excited to move forward towards getting more practice with all of the concepts and ideas that were introduced in this section, as most of it was code-along. It would've been a lot fo grasp alone, considering that we went through opening files (as well as reading and writing them), using external APIs, creating template files, writing to those templates systematically, playing with Date and Time, as well as the other things I'm sure aren't coming to mind at the moment. 
- Overall this felt like a great introduction to a lot of ideas that I'm sure will continue to get fleshed out in the next few lessons.
