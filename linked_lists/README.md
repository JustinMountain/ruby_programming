- Once I was able to get the ball rolling on this project, I was able to knock out all of the different methods in quick succession. The hardest part of this project was figuring out how to check that my functions were working appropriately. I ended up making a helped method to print out the linked list so that I could check my progress. Once that was established and I was able to check my work as I went along, the project was relatively straight forward. It actually took a lot longer than I'd like to admit to get to that point, but in retrospect it was a great learneing experience. I still have a tendency to get stuck on simple things that once found, I kick myself for getting stuck on. I think the probelm this time around was a case of trying to get too much done too quickly, because as soon as I slowed myself down and focused on getting the necessary feedback to the consol, I was able to iron out the append and prepend functions, which snowballed into the others relatively quickly.
- Overall this was another great project. The lessons prior to this were focused largely on recursion, but I didn't use it to solve anything in this problem set. I recognized that I probably could have (should have?) set up recursion for the pop and to_s methods, but I was in the groove solving everything with iteration that it seemed like a lot more effort than necessary for this particular problem. I'm glad that I have learned about recursion and will do some extra-cirricular studying on it, but this project just didn't seem like the best place to practice.
