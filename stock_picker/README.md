- This project was much more difficult than it should've been. I attribute this to the difference in syntax. I feel like I have completed the project using JavaScript, rather than Ruby despite having written the program in Ruby. I was able to solve the problem, but it is not the most beautiful code to look at.
- Now that I've looked over some of the solutions, I can see where I have strayed from the pack. I should've known I was not taking the path of least resistence when I discovered that Ruby doesn't use ++ increments. I knew that I needed to use a loop inside another loop. The top solution is very elegant; my solution constantly checked if the current comparison was the best, where that solution does all of the necessary math, sorts it, then chooses the values with the largest difference. Now that I've seen this solution, I'll keep it in my repertoire for the future.
