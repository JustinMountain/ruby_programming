- Recursive delete implemented by translating code from C# (iterative approach can be found in history)
  - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-2-delete/?ref=lbp
- Found an iterative solution to delete but it doesn't seem right; will investigate recursive solution
- Insert completed
- build_tree will recursively build the BST with an array
- Node and Tree classes established
- Directory and files established
