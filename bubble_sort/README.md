- This project was not so bad. I knew how to tackle this problem, so the psuedo code and coding weren't so difficult. I was able to implement a solution without much issue, but while doing so I was reminded how important it is to find the simplest action that will be repeated, to code that first, and to take things one step at a time. I still ended up using an iterative += 1 expression to solve this problem despite what I learned from the last exercise; it just seems like a logical way for me to solve these types of problems.
- Looking at the posted solutions, it seems that many people used the for i in 0.. expression. I will look into that before continuing forward with the next projects as well.
